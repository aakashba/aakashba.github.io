I am a PhD student at the University of Notre dame advised by Prof. Collin McMillan in the software engineering lab. I work on developing intelligent techniques for software engineering. My current research is at the cross-section of NLP and Software Engineering. I am currently applying for tenure-track faculty positions in computer science and engineering for Fall 2023. I expect to defend my thesis in May 2023.

I have a diverse background in development of intelligent tools. I earned my Masters in Computer Vision and Machine Learning at the University of Surrey with distinction. For my mastersâ€™ thesis, I worked with Prof. Philip Evans  on automated medical imaging of hypoxic cancer cells .
