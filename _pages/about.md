I am a PhD student at the University of Notre dame advised by Prof. Collin McMillan in the software engineering lab.  Before pursuing my PhD, I earned my Masters in Computer Vision and Machine Learning at the University of Surrey with distinction. I work on developing intelligent techniques for software engineering. 


My current research is at the cross-section of NLP, AI, and Software Engineering. At a high-level, my graduate work and thesis has been aimed at designing custom and purpose-built neural networks for source code summarization, particularly for adding contextual information. Source code summarization is a well-defined task of taking source code and generating natural language descriptions, with applications in code documentation, education, and software maintainance to name a few. 


I will be on the Academic job market for Fall 2024 start. I am interested in mainatining a quality-first research program with graduate students and contribute to the edification on undergraduate students I am looking for tenure-track faculty positions in computer science and engineering. I expect to defend my thesis in April 2024.
