Hi! I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Louisiana State University. This fall I will teach CSC 3102 - Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms.

I recently earned my PhD from the University of Notre dame advised by [Prof. Collin McMillan](https://sdf.org/~cmc/) in the Automatic Program Comprehension Lab (APCL).  Before that, I earned my Masters in Computer Vision and Machine Learning at the University of Surrey with distinction. I work on developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques with applications in Software Engineering (SE). My research interests are at the intersection of AI and SE. My long-term research objective is to bridge the gap between human program comprehension and automatic program comprehension. My short-term research focus is the advancement of neural networks specializing in modeling source code. Specifically, source code summarization, a well-defined task of taking source code and generating natural language descriptions, with applications in code documentation, education, and software maintainance to name a few. I am also interested in bio-inspired machine intelligence that drives my ongoing research.

I am hiring self-motivated PhD students for fully-funded postions in my lab. Interested candidates may reach out through the email icon below with their CV and description of research interests.
