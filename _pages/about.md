I am an A.B.D doctoral candidate at the University of Notre dame advised by Prof. Collin McMillan in the Automatic Program Comprehension Lab (APCL).  Before pursuing my PhD, I earned my Masters in Computer Vision and Machine Learning at the University of Surrey with distinction. I work on developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques with applications in Software Engineering (SE). 


My research interests are at the intersection of AI and SE. My long-term research objective is to bridge the gap between human program comprehension and automatic program comprehension. My short-term research focus is the advancement of neural networks specializing in modeling source code. Specifically, source code summarization, a well-defined task of taking source code and generating natural language descriptions, with applications in code documentation, education, and software maintainance to name a few. I am also interested in bio-inspired machine intelligence that drives my ongoing research.

I am on the job market in 2024! I am looking for tenure-track Assistant Professorships or Research Scientist positions in Industry.
